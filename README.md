## Overview
This repository focuses on implementing different neural network architectures and machine learning techniques, covering fundamental topics in computational intelligence. The following models and concepts are implemented:

- Single Perceptron
- One-layer Multi Perceptron
- Multi-layer Perceptron
- PyTorch implementations for neural networks

## Implemented Models
### 1. Single Perceptron
A basic implementation of a single-layer perceptron, demonstrating how a simple neural network can classify linearly separable data.

### 2. One-Layer Multi Perceptron
Extending the single perceptron model to handle multi-class classification using multiple perceptrons in one layer.

### 3. Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP)
A fully connected neural network with multiple hidden layers, capable of solving more complex, non-linear classification problems.

## PyTorch Implementations
For the above models, PyTorch versions are provided to make use of powerful libraries for deep learning, allowing for efficient model training and scaling.

## Additional Techniques
Familiarity with the following advanced neural network techniques is demonstrated:

- **Data Augmentation**: Techniques to increase the diversity of training data to improve model generalization.
- **Batch Normalization**: A method to normalize the inputs of each layer in order to speed up training and make the network more stable.
- **Dropout**: A regularization technique to prevent overfitting by randomly dropping units during training.
- **Activation Functions**: Implementation of various activation functions like ReLU, Sigmoid, Tanh, and others to introduce non-linearity into the models.

## K-Means Clustering
An implementation of the K-Means clustering algorithm, which groups data points into clusters based on feature similarity.
