are you familiar with The Space Station Remote Manipulator System (SSRMS)?
The Space Station Remote Manipulator System (SSRMS) is a 7 DoF robot which has 7 revolute joints and two long flexible links (booms).
The SSRMS have no uniform mass and stiffness distributions. Most of its masses are concentrated at the joints, and the joint structural flexibilities contribute a major portion of the overall arm flexibility. 

i want to write the code for simulation. this is instruction:
Assume that M is not recognized in the robot arm, identify this system. We want the end of the vector to follow the sin10t path.
where [q1, q2] = x1 is the position at the end of each link, x2=d(x1)/dt is the speed at the end of each link, u is the torque, M is the inertia matrix, C is the Curiolis and centrifugal forces, D is the viscous damping and g is the gravity force. It is defined as follows:‬‬
